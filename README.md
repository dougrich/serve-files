# Serve Files

> THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR USE IN PRODUCTION. It's only useful for small projects at home that can be backed by the filesystem and are running in secure environments.

This serves up simple files and allows posting back to modify form fields.

Additionally there is a 'shortcut' page that allows commands to be run.
